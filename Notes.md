need to "gem install" pry, httparty (all lower case), and json to get it to work, bake in installation of these gems at some point

my api will be the DnD 5e api: http://www.dnd5eapi.co/

What it should do:
1 Spit out a list of classes to choose from
2 allow user to select a class to get more information about said class
